   - WebKit (Safari)
3. **Test Configuration** - `playwright.config.ts`
4. **Test Suites:**
   - `tests/basic.spec.ts` - Basic navigation and load tests
   - `tests/navbar-transitions.spec.ts` - Comprehensive transition tests

## Available Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with browser UI visible
npm run test:headed

# Run specific browser tests
npm run test:chrome
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:safari

# Run mobile tests
npm run test:mobile

# Debug tests interactively
npm run test:debug

# Open Playwright UI
npm run test:ui

# View test report
npm run report

# Generate test code by recording
npm run codegen
```

## Test Coverage

### 1. **Transition Tests** (`navbar-transitions.spec.ts`)
- Navbar entrance animation verification
- Pill selection animations
- Content transition smoothness
- Styling validation

### 2. **Performance Tests**
- Page load metrics
- FPS monitoring (60fps target)
- Animation performance measurement
- DOM interaction timing

### 3. **Responsiveness Tests**
- Mobile viewport adaptation
- Desktop/tablet layouts
- Cross-browser compatibility

### 4. **Accessibility Tests**
- ARIA labels verification
- Keyboard navigation
- Semantic HTML structure

## Running Tests

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test the deployed version
npx playwright test tests/basic.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests on all browsers
npm test
```

### Visual Testing
```bash
# Run with screenshots
npx playwright test --screenshot=on --video=on
```

## Test Results

Initial test run results:
- ✅ App loads successfully (4.5s)
- ✅ Page load time measurement (3.4s average)
- ✅ Transition screenshots captured

## Screenshots Location

Test screenshots are saved to:
- `app-loaded.png` - Initial load state
- `screenshots/1-initial.png` - Initial state
- `screenshots/2-navbar-visible.png` - After navbar animation
- `screenshots/3-after-click.png` - After interaction

## CI/CD Integration

To integrate with CI/CD:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Install Playwright
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps

- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: npm test

- name: Upload test results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  if: always()
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

## Debugging Failed Tests

1. **View trace files:**
```bash
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

2. **Debug mode:**
```bash
npm run test:debug
```

3. **UI Mode:**
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Target metrics for the floating navbar app:
- Page Load: < 5 seconds
- FPS: > 30fps (ideally 60fps)
- First Contentful Paint: < 2 seconds
- Time to Interactive: < 3 seconds

## MCP Integration

Playwright can be integrated with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for:
- Automated test generation
- Visual regression testing
- Performance monitoring
- Accessibility audits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser not found:**
```bash
npx playwright install
```

2. **Test timeout:**
Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`:
```typescript
use: {
  timeout: 60000, // 60 seconds
}
```

3. **Flutter app not loading:**
Ensure Flutter web build is optimized:
```bash
flutter build web --release
```

## Next Steps

1. Add visual regression tests
2. Implement E2E user journey tests
3. Set up continuous monitoring
4. Add performance budgets
5. Create custom reporters
